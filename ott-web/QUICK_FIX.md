# Quick Fix: Get Video Working Now

## 🚀 **Immediate Solution**

The video player is now fixed and will automatically fall back to MP4 playback. But your current video URL might not be working.

## 🔧 **Quick Test - Use This Working Video URL:**

```sql
-- Update The Mandalorian with a working test video
UPDATE public.titles 
SET playback_url = 'https://sample-videos.com/zip/10/mp4/SampleVideo_1280x720_1mb.mp4'
WHERE title = 'The Mandalorian';
```

## 📋 **What This Does:**

1. **Uses a known working MP4 file** (1MB test video)
2. **Automatically detects MP4 format** and plays directly
3. **No HLS issues** - pure MP4 playback
4. **Should work immediately** after refresh

## 🎯 **After Running the SQL:**

1. **Refresh your app**
2. **Go to the Watch page** for The Mandalorian
3. **Video should start playing** automatically
4. **Check browser console** for success messages

## 🎬 **For Your Actual Movie:**

Once you confirm the test video works:

1. **Upload your movie** to a service like:
   - [WeTransfer](https://wetransfer.com) (free)
   - [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com) (free tier)
   - [YouTube](https://youtube.com) (unlisted)

2. **Get the direct video URL**

3. **Update with your movie:**
```sql
UPDATE public.titles 
SET playback_url = 'YOUR_ACTUAL_MOVIE_URL_HERE'
WHERE title = 'The Mandalorian';
```

## ✅ **Expected Results:**

- **No more "HLS not supported" error**
- **Video loads and plays automatically**
- **All controls work** (play, pause, volume, fullscreen)
- **Progress tracking works**

## 🐛 **If Still Not Working:**

Check the browser console for:
- `"Using direct MP4 playback for: [URL]"`
- Any error messages
- Network tab for failed requests

## 🎉 **Success Indicators:**

- Video loads without errors
- Play button appears
- Progress bar shows
- Controls are responsive

Try the test video first - it should work immediately!
